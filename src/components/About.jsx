      <div className='about-right'>Hey! I'm Sai Kiran Varma, a Lead AI Engineer at CampX with 2+ years of experience in GenAI, LLM integration, and full-stack AI systems development.

I specialize in building production-ready AI solutions including RAG-based systems, vector databases (Chroma DB), and LLM-driven agents that handle 1M+ requests/second. My expertise spans across Python, AWS cloud infrastructure (Lambda, EC2, RDS, ECS, Step Functions), and modern web technologies (React, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL).

Previously led a team at Janaspandana Software Solutions where I developed PromptKey, an AI benchmarking platform integrating 180+ AI models. I'm passionate about architecting scalable AI solutions that deliver quantifiable business impact - reducing support costs by 35%, improving efficiency by 60%, and cutting processing time by 50%.</div>
